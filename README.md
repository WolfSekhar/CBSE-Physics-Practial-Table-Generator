# CBSE-Physics-Practial-Table-Generator
It generates tabular values for CBSE XII Physics Practical.

## How To Run

### Windows
[Download Program](https://github.com/WolfSekhar/CBSE-Physics-Practial-Table-Generator/releases/latest/download/PhyPGen_by_PSEKHAR.exe)

### Linux/Mac/Unix
1. Install python
2. Run `pip install matplotlib rich art` (You may want to install these using your package manager if you're on Arch/NixOS/GuixSD etc.)
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/WolfSekhar/CBSE-Physics-Practial-Table-Generator.git`
4. Run `cd CBSE-Physics-Practial-Table-Generator`
5. Run `python main.py` or use the `./run.sh` script

<i>Keep in mind that the values change every time you run the script</i>


## Experiments included 
1. To determine resistivity of two / three wires  by plotting a graph for potential difference versus current.
2. To find resistance of a given wire / standard resistor using metre bridge.
3. To verify the laws of combination (series) of resistances using a metre bridge.
4. To verify the laws of combination (parallel) of resistances using a metre bridge.
5. To determine resistance of a galvanometer by half-deflection method and to find itsfigure of merit
6. To convert the given galvanometer (of known resistance and figure of merit) into a voltmeter of desired range and to verify.
7. To find the value of v for different values of u in case of a concave mirror and to find the focal length.
