# CBSE-Physics-Practial-Table-Generator
It generates tabular values for CBSE XII Physics Practical



## How to run
1. Python
2. pip install matplotlib rich
3. git clone https://github.com/WolfSekhar/CBSE-Physics-Practial-Table-Generator.git
4. run the following command for required experiment <br>
    Example : <br>
    py resistivity_vi.py <br>
    <i>Keep in mind that the values change every time you run the script</i>
5. If you want to save the result <br>
    py resistivity_vi.py > filename.txt <br>
    <i>This will save the table in a text file. </i> 



## Experiments included 
1. To determine resistivity of two / three wires by plotting a graph for potential
difference versus current.
2. To find resistance of a given wire / standard resistor using metre bridge.
3. To verify the laws of combination (series) of resistances using a metre bridge. <br>
 OR <br>
To verify the laws of combination (parallel) of resistances using a metre bridge.
